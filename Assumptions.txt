Work flow assumptions :
 Customer will contact and ask for questions about coway products, 
 if customer is new and interested to buy, sales will input a new customer and if customer already exists,
 sales can skip registration phase and input order,
 I'm sorry, I am not capable to integrate for payment link generated right now.
 sales will input orders and upload a photo (I assume the document is need only 1 and it's should be KTP) before save and link payment will generated (skip)
 after payment, admin level 1 will verify the documents and admin level 2 will approved, if approved it will proceed to install verification from admin level 1
 if success then technician will assign ct and will update the status of installation and if success it will proceed to completed status
 if admin level 1 not success verify customer order or technician not success to install it will proceed to refund process
 and user accounts payable will refund and order will be canceled.
 
 for customer type and payment type, I assume it's outright and installment.
 service package will be 12, 24, 36 installment package for customer below 65 years old and only 65 or above 65 have outright service package

 menu visibility :
 1. Sales = only can access customer and order menu
 2. Admin level 1 : only can access dashboard and can verify document, process to verify call log,
		    update rejected order to refund process and will be process by account payable
 3. Admin level 2 : can access and manipulate all menu, however Admin level 2 only can approved document that already verified from admin level 1
 4. Technician : only can access dashboard, techinican only assign ct and update the status of installation.
 5. Accounts Payable : only can access dashboard, Accounts Payable only process refund
 
Person in charge (PIC) and CT cannot login
